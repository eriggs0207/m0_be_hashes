# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

It took me a few minutes to realize I had to comment out all the existing code in the files before I started writing my own.  After reading the error messages I found out there was syntax not commented out and fixed it.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

It is going well.  I take the most notes when I am reading the lessons.  I need to be better about taking notes of actual code when I am writing as examples to reference. Especially when I have a productive struggle and come out with a solution.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I try to solve a problem in code first, then reference my notes/turing site, then I google.
